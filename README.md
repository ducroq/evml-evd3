# EVML-EVD3

This repository contains the materials for the EVD3 course of the minor Embedded Vision and Machine Learning.
The course is concerned with machine learning and deep learning as applied in computer vision.
We focus on application, training, finetuning and performance analysis.
We take a hands-on approach here, and you will start working on a machine learning project right from the start of the semester.
You are invited to contribute to our collection of applications: https://padlet.com/jeroen_veen/zul8z8tbvhqpvb8t

## Book

Géron, A. (2019). *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2nd ed.)*. O’Reilly Media (ISBN: 9781492032649).

## Course assessment

During the course you will work on 2 mini projects. Furthermore, there will be a theory quiz every other scheduled lesson.
You will receive two grades, which are composed as:

1. Machine learning project report (80%) and quizzes (20%)
2. Deep learning project report (80%) and quizzes (20%)


###  Mini learning projects

* A project team consists of 2-3 students
* Report building using templates (see templates/)
* Deliver (intermediate) results via InleverAPP as indicated in the schedule

### Quizzes
* Individual, multiple choice questions
* Online http://www.socrative.com room 1PTGB6PY
* Open book quiz, so books and slides can be consulted
* HAN student number, so NOT your name, nickname or anything else
* Quiz starts exactly at class hour and takes 10 minutes
* Be on time and have your equipment prepared
* During the quiz: no entering or leaving the classroom, and silence


## Software development environments

You can download and install the following software:

* [A Git client](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Python packages
Use pip as a tool for installing Python packages, such as OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras.<br />
<code> pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn imutils opencv-python</code>

## Using GitLab

If you don't know how to use GitLab, you can simply download this repository as a ZIP archive. The downside is that you will have to check this repository for updates manually on a regular interval and merge changes by hand.<br />
If you would like to get started with GitLab, refer to the following [instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html).<br />
<br />
As a reminder, here is a list of git command line commands that are often used:

* Clone via HTTPS (only the first time)<br />
  <code>git clone https://gitlab.com/jeroen_veen/evml-evd3.git</code>
* Receive changes from GitLab.com<br />
  <code>git pull origin master</code>


## Raspberry pi install

* Raspberry Pi Imager (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
* To enable SSH, create a file named ssh in boot partition
* To install opencv, see e.g. (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/16/install-opencv-4-on-raspberry-pi-4-and-raspbian-buster/)
* Find latest successful builds for Raspbian here (https://www.piwheels.org/) and install using pip
